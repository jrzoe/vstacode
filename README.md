# Tips for working on Taco

I initally made this repo as a resource for those who may want to use VS Code when working interactively on BCM's MHGCP, aka Taco. I decided to expand this to include some other helpful tips for working on Taco/high-performance computing (HPC) systems in general. 

## Topics

- [Using VS Code on Taco via code-server](./docs/code_server.md)

## TODO

Some things I'll add to this repo:

- Instructions for getting GitHub Copilot working within your code-server instance
- Adding aliases for tunneling command rather than copying/pasting them (helpful if the command gets lost in your terminal history).
- Helpful tips on config for code-server
- Working with R environments on Taco and within code-server

Please submit an issue or PR if you have suggestions or contributions! Hoping to make this as helpful as possible for all users.
