# Workflow tips for bioinformaticians and computational biologists

I initally made this repo as a resource for colleagues at BCM who had expressed interest in using VS Code when working interactively on a large compute cluster nicknames Taco (hence the repo name). Over the course of my PhD, I've often worked on a team across projects, and in doing so, I've come across some workflow barriers that I suspect are common to many computational biologists and/or bioinformaticians working in academia. I decided to expand this repo to include some suggested workflow tips across a few topics, linked below. 

## Topics

- [Using VS Code on a compute cluster via code-server](./docs/code_server.md)
- [Source-controlled collaboration on big data projects](./docs/team_source_control.md)

## TODO

Some things I'll add to this repo:

- Adding aliases for tunneling command rather than copying/pasting them (helpful if the command gets lost in your terminal history).
- Helpful tips on config for code-server
- Working with R environments on Taco and within code-server

Please submit an issue or PR if you have suggestions or contributions! Hoping to make this as helpful as possible for all users.
