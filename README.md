# Workflow tips for bioinformaticians and computational biologists

I initally made this repo as a resource for colleagues at BCM who had expressed interest in using VS Code when working interactively on a large compute cluster nicknames Taco (hence the repo name). Over the course of my PhD, I've often worked on a team across projects, and in doing so, I've come across some workflow barriers that I suspect are common to many computational biologists and/or bioinformaticians working in academia. I decided to expand this repo to include some suggested workflow tips across a few topics, linked below.

## Topics

- [Using VS Code on a compute cluster via code-server](./docs/code_server.md)
- [Structuring your lab directory](./docs/structure_lab_dir.md)
- [Source-controlled collaboration on big data projects](./docs/team_source_control.md)
- [Backends and frontends for big data in R and Python](./docs/backends_frontends.md)
- [Working with R in code-server](./docs/working_with_R.md)

## TODO

Some things I'll add to this repo:

- Adding aliases for tunneling command rather than copying/pasting them (helpful if the command gets lost in your terminal history).

Please submit an issue or PR if you have suggestions or contributions! I'm only speaking from the limited experience I've had, so I'm sure there are many more helpful tips out there.
